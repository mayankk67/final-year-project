intensity: number of photons collected by pixels
range: 0-255

resolution of an image is number of rows and columns of the image

image procession is done to enhance the image and information extraction.


Steps in image processing:
1. image acquisition-giving input
2. preprocessing-convert them into different  colour module
3. segmentation- covert the background into white and object into black
4. noise removal- removal of unwanted section
5. feature extraction-counting the number of match

two toolboxes are: image processing toolbox and computer vision toolbox
reading image of choice - imread

synatx: imread('path of image\name of the image.ext')

other extension which can be read in matlab:png, ppm, gif and tif

<202x249x3 uint8>
202 - rows
249 - columns 
3 - rgb
uint 8 - data type

imtool(variable name) - displaying image suing the variables.

r=a(:,:,1)

Preprocessing:
We covnert the image into colour model and see in which colour model it looks different
1. RGB
2. GREYSCALE
3. YCbCr
4. HSV

average of red green and blue- greyscale

application -cctv

covert rgb to greyscale : gr=rgb2gray(a)

YCbCr: y is greyscale or intensity,brightness
Cb- Chroma blue- Difference between brightness and blue
Cr- Chroma red- Difference between brigtness and red

conver rgb to ycbcr: cr=rgb2ycbcr(a)

hsv- hue saturation and value
Sturation tells amount of colour
luminance - brightness of environment

threshold automation- otsu

OTSU ::

step1- histogram
	graph of bins(intensity between 0.00 - 1.00) vs counts (number of pixels)
